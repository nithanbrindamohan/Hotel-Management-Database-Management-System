# Hotel-Management-Database-Management-System
## Overview
# This project is a full Hotel Management Database Management System (DBMS) designed and implemented as part of a multi-phase database development assignment. The system models real-world hotel operations, including guests, rooms, reservations, and payments, while enforcing strong data integrity and normalization principles. The project demonstrates both theoretical database design and practical implementation using Oracle SQL and Java.

## Project Objectives
# Design a realistic hotel database with meaningful entities and relationships
# Apply ER modeling and relational schema design principles
# Implement the database using Oracle SQL
# Enforce data integrity through constraints and normalization (3NF/BCNF)
# Query and interact with the database using SQL, shell scripts, and a Java-based UI

## Technologies Used
# Oracle SQL — database creation, constraints, queries, views
# Unix Shell Scripts — menu-driven interaction and query execution
# Java — front-end UI for database interaction
# Relational Database Design — ER modeling, normalization, functional dependencies

### Project Breakdown
## Phase I — Design
# Defined system requirements and application scope
# Designed ER diagrams with entities and relationships
# Converted ER models into relational schemas

## Phase II — Implementation
# Created and populated Oracle database tables
# Developed SQL queries, joins, aggregations, and views
# Built a Unix shell menu for database interaction
# Implemented a Java-based UI for user-friendly access

## Phase III — Normalization & Documentation
# Identified functional dependencies
# Normalized tables to 3NF and BCNF
# Validated design using test data and query results

### Future Improvements
# Enhanced Java UI features
# Transaction handling and concurrency control
# Support for multi-branch hotel operations
